# EC400 Group 6 RL Final Project

This is the GitHub of Group 6 for their EC400 Final Project. After the report has been graded and all the grades are out, this repository will go private.

# Contents

This Repository includes all the planners, controllers, and additional code we modified or created in order to test our discoveries. There are 3 branches: the main, planner and utils. You can find all of our work however in the main branch. These folders in the main branch contain our planners, controllers, data we compiled, utils we modified, and Brian's Runtime_to_file python code for easier compiling of data. In addition, you can find some images that we got from testing.

# Results

As we stated in the paper, we got better results than our previous coding 5 assignment due to the allowance of any general method we could use. The changing of player to AI immensely helped with testing and our results improved. You can find all the tabular results in the Runtime Records folder as well as our slides.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank all the faculty invovled in the process.
